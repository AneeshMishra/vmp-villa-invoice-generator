# VMP Villa Invoice Generator - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local if you need environment variables

# Vercel Blob Storage (automatically provided by Vercel deployment)
# BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here

# Note: When deployed to Vercel, the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is automatically
# injected as an environment variable. You only need to set this for local
# development if you want to test Vercel Blob Storage locally.

# To get your local token:
# 1. Deploy to Vercel first
# 2. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
# 3. Copy the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN value
# 4. Create .env.local and paste it there

# API Base URL (if you add a backend later)
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# Add any other environment variables here as needed
